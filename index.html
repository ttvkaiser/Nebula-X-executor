  <h2>What is NEBULA X?</h2>
  <p><strong>NEBULA X</strong> is more than just an executor — it’s a gateway into the unknown. Forged from the depths of raw Lua, shaped by innovation, and cloaked in mystery, this tool unlocks the unseen power within Roblox.</p>
  <p>Whether you’re scripting silently in the shadows or commanding Nebula Hub with unbreakable control, NEBULA X gives you the edge no one sees coming.</p>
  <p>Designed for speed, precision, and ultimate customization, NEBULA X empowers both mobile and PC warriors with an interface that’s as clean as it is lethal. With seamless support for <strong>Nebula Hub</strong>, real-time updates, and a zero-crash execution core, it’s not just a script runner — it’s your digital weapon.</p>
  <p><em>They won’t see it coming. You will.</em></p>
</section>

<section class="notice-box">
  <h2>Status Update</h2>
  <p><strong>NEBULA X is not available for download — yet.</strong> We are currently deep in development, crafting an Android version that meets the highest standards of stealth, speed, and stability.</p>
  <p>Our mission is clear: to ensure NEBULA X runs at <strong>100% undetectable power</strong>. That means no risk of bans, no unstable behavior, and no compromise on execution. We’re building something that not only performs — but protects.</p>
  <p>While others rush to release broken tools, we remain in the shadows — refining, testing, and evolving. The mobile battlefield demands perfection, and we will deliver nothing less.</p>
  <p><em>Be patient, warrior. The true executor is coming.</em></p>
</section>

<section class="story-box">
  <h2>How We Started</h2>
  <p>Every great tool begins with a spark — and NEBULA X was no different. Our journey began with a curious and determined young mind, experimenting with the most well-known free executors: CodeX, Delta, Solara, Fluxus, and Arc X. Each one offered power, yet came with limits — lag, crashes, unstable updates, and worse: keys, ads, and risk of bans. It wasn’t enough. There had to be more.</p>

  <p>Then came Ronix. In that moment, something changed. With sharper performance and cleaner delivery, it sparked a question: <em>“Wait… what if I could make my own?”</em> That single thought became the foundation of a vision — not just to build another executor, but to create the one that finally gets it right.</p>

  <p>From those early experiments rose NEBULA X — a full remake of our former project <strong>Nebula</strong>, now reimagined, recoded, and redefined from the ground up. No recycled modules. No shortcuts. Every function, every interface, and every execution pathway is built with one goal in mind: <strong>to deliver a truly premium Roblox experience</strong>.</p>

  <p>We made a promise — that NEBULA X will always be <strong>keyless</strong>. While others go keyless only to lock you out later, we stand firm. No gimmicks. No gatekeeping. Just power, freely given.</p>

  <p>And this is only the beginning. With each line of code, we’re building not just a tool — we’re building a legacy. Welcome to NEBULA X.</p>
</section>

<section class="sponsor-box">
  <h2>Our Official Sponsor</h2>
  <p>Behind every powerful tool lies a force that fuels its growth. For <strong>NEBULA X</strong>, that force is none other than our official sponsor: <strong>Nebula Hub</strong>.</p>

  <p>Nebula Hub isn’t just a script — it’s a universe of control, precision, and creativity. Known for its sleek interface, deep game integrations, and customizable tabs powered by the Fluent UI experience, Nebula Hub has reshaped what it means to enhance your gameplay. Whether dominating in <em>Fisch</em>, strategizing in <em>Blox Fruits</em>, or breaking limits in <em>Blue Lock Rivals</em>, it’s the go-to hub for Roblox players who crave something more than ordinary.</p>

  <p>It was only natural that NEBULA X would rise with Nebula Hub by its side. One runs the code. The other shapes the world. Together, they form a seamless bridge between execution and immersion. A powerhouse built not on flash, but on foundation. Not on hype, but on heritage.</p>

  <p>With Nebula Hub as our foundation, NEBULA X is engineered to fully support every function of the hub from the moment of launch — no configuration required. No lag. No limitations. Just instant, pure compatibility built on shared DNA.</p>

  <p>This partnership isn’t just strategic. It’s spiritual. Two projects, born from the same vision, now walk the same path — to bring you a Roblox experience that feels like magic, runs like lightning, and empowers like nothing else.</p>

  <p><em>Nebula Hub. Nebula X. The stars align.</em></p>
